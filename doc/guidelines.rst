Coding Guidelines
=================

When contributing to the pyhole project, please be sure to read over the
following information.

Python Style
------------

General
^^^^^^^

* Two newlines between toplevel imports, classes, functions, etc
* One newline between anything not mentioned above
* Make an honest effort at not catching all exceptions
* Do not name anything the same as builtin or reserved words
* Use double quotes (") whenever possible
* Everything must be PEP8-compliant: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

Imports
^^^^^^^

* Import only modules
* Import one module per line
* Imports are grouped by *import* and *from*
* Imports should be in alphabetical order in their groups

::

    import json
    import re

    from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup

    from pyhole.core import plugin
    from pyhole.core import utils

Docstrings
^^^^^^^^^^

::

    """This is a single-line docstring."""

    """This is a multi-line docstring.

    Second paragraph goes like this. Ending quotes are on their own line.
    """

Testing
-------

Every new piece of code must be covered by a unit test. One must also ensure
that all tests pass before submitting code. Testing examples can be found in
the *pyhole/tests* directory.
